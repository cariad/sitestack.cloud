      <h2>What does sitestack.cloud deploy?</h2>

      <div class="columns">

        <h3>S3 bucket</h3>

        <p>When you’re ready to publish, just upload to your website’s S3 bucket.</p>

        <p>We even include an IAM user with minimal permissions for your automated deployments.</p>

        <h3>Custom domain name and HTTPS</h3>

        <p>As you’d expect, we make your website available at <code class="url">https://<span class="placeholder">yourdomain.com</span></code>.</p>

        <p>We care about security, so we redirect <code class="url">http://</code> to <code class="url">http<span style="color: var(--red);">s</span>://</code>.</p>

        <p>And we love when websites have canonical URLs, so we redirect <code class="url">www.<span class="placeholder">yourdomain.com</span></code> to <code class="url"><span class="placeholder">yourdomain.com</span></code> too.

        <div class="column-break"></div>

        <h3>Beautiful directory handling</h3>

        <p>Say you want your contact details published at <code class="url">https://<span class="placeholder">yourdomain.com</span>/contact</code>.</p>

        <p>To achieve that, you’ll need the directory structure <code class="path">…/contact/index.html</code>.</p>

        <p>Traditional web servers will assume that any visitors requesting the <code class="path">contact</code> directory should <em>really</em> be served the <code class="path">index.html</code> file within.</p>

        <p>But S3 isn’t a traditional web server. It’s a literal key/value store. Your visitors would need to hit <code class="url">https://<span class="placeholder">yourdomain.com</span>/contact/index.html</code>. And that’s just ugly.</p>

        <p>So, we deploy Lambda@Edge functions to make <code class="url">https://<span class="placeholder">yourdomain.com</span>/contact</code> beautiful.</p>

      </div>


      <h2>Requirements</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>An Amazon Web Services account.</li>
        <li>A Hosted Zone for the domain name.</li>
        <li>You must deploy the stack to the same AWS account as the Hosted Zone.</li>
        <li>You must deploy the stack to <code>us-east-1</code>.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Deploying</h2>

      <p><a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/create/review?templateURL=https://s3.amazonaws.com/releases.sitestack.cloud/latest.cf.yml"><img src="cloudformation-launch-stack-button-svg/launch-stack.svg" /></a></p>

      <ol>
        <li>Click <em>Launch Stack</em>.</li>
        <li>
          Configure the stack:
          <ul>
            <li><span class="label">Stack name:</span> The name won’t affect your website at all, but you’ll need to find this stack later to update or delete it.</li>
            <li><span class="label">Domain name:</span> Your custom domain. Don’t put “www.” on the front.</li>
            <li><span class="label">Hosted Zone ID:</span> Click and select the Hosted Zone for your custom domain.</li>
            <li><span class="label">Default TTL:</span> Your website will be cached in a global content delivery network, so changes to files won’t be immediately visible on the web. Enter here the number of seconds to cache your content for. Higher values are more efficient. Minimum 60 seconds.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Click <span class="label">Create stack</span>.</li>
        <li>Wait approximately 20 minutes for the deployment to complete.</li>
        <li>All done! Now you’re ready to upload your website.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Uploading your website</h2>

      <h3>Uploading your website manually</h3>

      <p>Log into your AWS account and find your website’s bucket. It’ll be called <code class="url"><span class="placeholder">stack</span>-bucket-<span class="placeholder">random</span></code>.</p>

      <p>Drag-and-drop your files into the bucket, and you’re done!</p>

      <h3>Uploading your website in a deployment pipeline</h3>

      <p>Log into your AWS account and find your website’s publisher. It’ll be an IAM user named <code class="url"><span class="placeholder">stack</span>-Publisher-<span class="placeholder">random</span></code>.</p>

      <p>Generate an access key/secret key pair, then use those credentials in your deployment pipeline to upload the website to the bucket.</p>

      <h2>FAQs</h2>

      <div class="columns">

        <h3>I uploaded some files, but my browser says my site “can’t be found”!</h3>

        <p>The domain name records will take some time to propagate after the deployment. It could be minutes, or it could be hours. Chill, my friend.</p>

        <h3>I uploaded some files, but my website still has the old versions!</h3>

        <p>CloudFront caches your files for some amount of time, so changes are not instantaneous. The duration will depend on the <span class="label">Default TTL</span> you entered during the deployment. If the duration is too long for your tastes, you can change it.</p>

        <h3>How do I change the “Default TTL”?</h3>

        <ol>
          <li>Log into your AWS account.</li>
          <li>Open the CloudFormation console, and open your website’s stack.</li>
          <li>Click <em>Update</em>.</li>
          <li>Select <em>Use current template</em>.</li>
          <li>Edit the <span class="label">Default TTL</span>.</li>
          <li>Click <em>Next</em> through the wizard, then finally <em>Update stack</em>.</li>
        </ol>

        <div class="column-break"></div>

        <h3>How can I change the HTTP headers returned for my files?</h3>

        <p>Check out <a href="https://github.com/cariad/s3headersetter">s3headersetter</a>, my CLI tool for setting HTTP headers for S3 objects.</p>

        <h3>How much does this cost?</h3>

        <p><span class="sitestack">sitestack.cloud</span> is provided as a free service; you only pay for your own Amazon Web Services costs.</p>

        <p>AWS charges by usage, which makes cost estimation tricky. Personally, I’m paying pennies per month to host half a dozen low-traffic sites.</p>

        <h3>How do I delete everything that this stack deployed?</h3>

        <ol>
          <li>Log into your AWS account.</li>
          <li>Open your S3 bucket and delete all the files. <em>The bucket must be empty before continuing.</em></li>
          <li>Find the CloudFormation stack and delete it.</li>
          <li>If the deletion fails with the error <code class="error">Lambda was unable to delete arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:<span class="placeholder">youraccount</span>:function:sitestackcloud-ViewerRequestHandler because it is a replicated function.</code> then go get a cup of coffee, watch Disney’s <em>Tomorrowland: A World Beyond</em>, then try again. Replicated functions can take a couple of hours to become deletable after their parent CloudFront distribution has evaporated.</li>
        </ol>
